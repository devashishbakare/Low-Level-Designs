Here we are using Strategy and Singleton design pattern

1) why strategy?
- you could see for make one move from cell A to cell B there are lot of options, user choose at run time which one he should go

2) singleton
- Everyone should update same board;

Some thing you need to know there
1) Everytime you write some code, look for some base cases and edge cases
2) Creating separate class for each and every type is important
3) This is nothing but "can you reach from one cell to another cell"
