Here we are using Flyweight Design Pattern

- Why we used Flyweight Pattern?
In problem statement we could see "any number of rows and any number of columns. Each character in the document has its own style"
Keeping Style for each character, as character may be any number of lines, and style itself limited here so why to keep new style object for each character

Here we can use same style object multiple time, hence we are caching like below
and in style we are keeping the styles as per need
important to note : caching, caching, caching, caching, caching, caching.......
private Map<Character, Style> charWithStyleMapper;
