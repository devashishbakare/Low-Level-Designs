Here we have used the chain of responsibility design pattern

why we use the COR pattern here?
There are different ways in which you can book ticket
leve1: do the seats booking first with continuous seats, low to high

If continuous seats are not available then pick seats from lowest row, column as mention in problem statement
level 2 : do the seat allocation as per above
There might be many condition which can comes in future, so if we use the COR pattern here we can open to extend

You can create a one central logger function, its not mention in problem statement but you can do that as well

Important to keep in mind
1) One function should have only one logic, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
2) Open/Closed Principle (OCP): we used COR above

3) Separation of Concerns
Different functionalities are neatly separated:
Cinema and Screen handle structure.
Show handles booking logic.
Ticket handles user-specific booking details.
